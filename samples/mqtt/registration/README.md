# MQTT registration example for the Astarte device

This sample shows the device registration functionality for the Astarte device library for C++.

## Configuration

The sample is already configured to perform a device registration to an Astarte instance.
The only thing you need to provide is a valid `config.json` file containing these fields:
- `pairing_url`, an URL of the Astarte component responsible for device registration
- `pairing_jwt`, a token necessary to authenticate though Astarte
- `realm`, the name of the Astarte realm where the device will be registered
- `device_id`, a 128bit URL encoded base64 string uniquelly identifying a device

## Building and running

To build this sample run the `build_sample.sh` present in the root of this project with your
preferred options. Run `build_sample.sh --help` for more info.

Running the sample should be done by excecuting the binary directly.
The binary generated by `build_sample.sh` can be found at `samples/mqtt/registration/build/app`.
