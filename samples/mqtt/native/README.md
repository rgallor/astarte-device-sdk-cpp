# MQTT example for the Astarte device

This sample shows the device sdk functionalities for the Astarte device library for C++, such as
the registration of a new device, its connection to Astarte through an MQTT connection, sending and
receiving data from/to Astarte, etc.

## Configure the sample
It is possible to configure the example by creating and modifying a `config.toml` file.
During the sdk development several paramenters will be added to this file to extend the
example functionalities.

An example of `config.toml` file is the following:
```
[general]
pairing_url = ""
realm = ""
device_id = ""

[mode]
DEVICE_REGISTRATION = true

[mode.registration]
pairing_jwt = ""

```

The sample is configured to perform a device registration to an Astarte instance.

The parameters you need to provide are:
- `pairing_url`, an URL of the Astarte component responsible for device registration
- `realm`, the name of the Astarte realm where the device will be registered
- `device_id`, a 128bit URL encoded base64 string uniquelly identifying a device
- `pairing_jwt`, a token necessary to authenticate though Astarte

## Building and running

To build this sample run the `build_sample.sh` present in the root of this project with your
preferred options. Run `build_sample.sh --help` for more info.

Running the sample should be done by excecuting the binary directly.
The binary generated by `build_sample.sh` can be found at `samples/mqtt/native/build/app`.
